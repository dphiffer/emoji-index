# Emoji Index

A developer-centric index of emoji based on information from [Emojipedia](http://emojipedia.org/) and [emoji-cheat-sheet.com](https://github.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com)

## What‚Äôs in here?

* __emoji-index.json__: all the emojis from Unicode 1.1 to Unicode 8.0, with `:thumbsup:`-style shortcuts and reference URLs to Emojipedia
* __emoji-lookup.json__: a barebones lookup hash for implementing emoji shortcuts
* __emoji-pretty.json__: a pretty-printed version of emoji-index.json

## Some examples

### emoji-index.json

```json
[{
	"alt_names": [
		"animal",
		"tortoise",
		"slow",
		"nature"
	],
	"emoji": "\ud83d\udc22",
	"shortcuts": [
		"turtle"
	],
	"since": "Unicode 6.0",
	"title": "Turtle",
	"url": "http://emojipedia.org/turtle/"
}]
```

### emoji-lookup.json

```json
{
	"cactus": "\ud83c\udf35"
}
```

## What is this for?

* Easily convert plain text like `:turtle:` to its emoji equivalent üê¢
* Determine how recently a given emoji was introduced based on its Unicode `since` property

## Are these shortcuts standardized?

Not as far as I know, it seems they're pretty much being invented ad-hoc by the people creating the software that supports them. It's amazing there is as much coherence among the list of compatible products listed on [emoji-cheat-sheet.com](http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com/), but you can find places where the naming conventions diverge. For example `:poop:`, `:shit:`, and `:hankey:` all map onto the same emoji symbol.

## Is this complete?

This is only as complete as Emojipedia and emoji-cheat-sheet.com. For now I‚Äôd rather downstream changes that originate from them to keep things sane. Feel free to create [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dphiffer/emoji-index/issues) if you notice anything missing.

## What about Unicode 9.0 and Unicode 10.0?

Seems too early at this point. But once [9.0](http://emojipedia.org/unicode-9.0/) starts shipping on some actual platforms I'll update this repo.
